RESTful Scholar Grades
========

What does it do?
-------------

Given your PID and password for [Scholar][1], this script will return all of your grades for all your classes in JSON format.

Why?
-----

I intend to create a web page that will use this data to present students' grades in a better way. Currently there's no central place to view all of ones grades.

You, however, can do whatever you'd like with the data. I'm currently in the process of setting up a page to make this a truly RESTful data source. I have a prototype of it working, but I need to consult with people who understand security to make sure it's secure.


Basic Usage
--------------

`python grades.py <your-pid> <your-password>`

Example of Data Returned
---------------------------

Coming soon.
